# Guided Practice — Lab 1.1 (Intro)

1) Predict the output:
```js
let x = 5;
let y = "5";
console.log(x + y);
```
55
Explain why that output occurs.
Cadenates it together
2) Fix the bug so each line logs a number, not a string:
```js
let a = "7";
let b = "3";
console.log(a + b);
```
let a = "7"
let b = "3"
console.log(Number(a) + Number(b))
