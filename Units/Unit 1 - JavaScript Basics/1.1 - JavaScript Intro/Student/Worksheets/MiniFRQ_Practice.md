# Mini FRQ â€” Lab 1.1 (Intro)

**Prompt:** Write JavaScript that declares two variables `width` and `height`. Compute and log the **area** and **perimeter** of a rectangle. Then log a sentence using template literals to summarize the results.
let width = 5;
let height = 4;
let area = width * height;
let perimeter = 2 * (width + height);

console.log("The area of the rectangle is ${area})
console.log("The perimeter of the rectangle is ${perimeter})
